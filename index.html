        We offer critical analysis of the latest developments in quantum computing and examine the potential impact of the technology on selected application areas. Our particular focus is on understanding when quantum computing could be useful for accelerating biotechnology. In order to proceed we identify the possible interaction channels between quantum computing and biotech. We have recognized that machine learning, optimization, and chemistry or physics simulation as domains which quantum computing could impact. We are unexperienced in biotech and will continue to learn more as this project continues. The first post will study using quantum computers to solve protein lattice models. The second post will study np-hard problems in biotech. The third post will study the ways that machine learning is being used in biotech. The fourth post will study ligand-binding models. The philosophy of this blog is to consistently produce the best possible content as quickly as possible. This requires stayiing focused on a single topic and producing as much material as quickly as possible. After a critical mass of content has been produced we will reexamine the presentation of the content.
